Currently, the application does not track activity across all applications on your system.
 The code shows that activity tracking is limited to interactions within the timetracker application window only.
To enable system-wide activity tracking, significant changes would be required:

Electron Native Modules:
 The application would need to use Electron's native modules to access system-level input events.

Operating System Permissions: 
The app would require explicit permissions from your operating system to monitor global keyboard and mouse events.

Code Changes: The current implementation using browser-based event listeners (window.addEventListener) 
would need to be replaced with platform-specific code using Electron's IPC to communicate with native modules.

Privacy Considerations: System-wide tracking raises privacy concerns and would likely require clear user consent.
This type of functionality is possible but would require substantial development work and would need
 to address important privacy and security considerations. The current code base does not have this
 capability implemented.
